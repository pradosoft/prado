## API Documentation
The complete API documentation can be found at http://pradosoft.github.io/docs/manual/

Prado uses ApiGen (http://www.apigen.org) to generate its API documentation.
An ApiGen configuration file is providen, to generate the documentation just execute
```./vendor/bin/apigen generate --config=.apigen.yaml```
The documentation will be generated in the `build/docs/` directory.

## Install

The best way to install Prado is [through composer](http://getcomposer.org).
If you don't use composer yet, first install it:
```sh
	# download composer.phar
	curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	# install it globally on the system
	mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Then, create the application structure using composer:
```sh	
	composer create-project pradosoft/prado-app app
```

The application will be installed in the "app" directory.

#### Add Prado to an existing application
Just create a composer.json file for your project:

```JSON
{
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "composer",
			"url": "https://asset-packagist.org"
		}
	],
    "require": {
        "pradosoft/prado": "~4.0"
    }
}
```

The [asset-packagist](https://asset-packagist.org) repository is used to install javascript dependencies.
Assuming you already installed composer, run

```sh
    composer install
```

Then you can include the autoloader, and you will have access to the library classes:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
## Demo Apps
Several different example prado applications are provided in the https://github.com/pradosoft/prado-demos repository. You can see these applications running here: http://www.pradoframework.net/site/demos/ .
When you create your own prado application you do NOT need these folders.

## Testing

Prado uses phpunit (https://phpunit.de/) for unit testing and Selenium (http://www.seleniumhq.org/) for functional testing.
A phpunit configuration file is providen, to run the tests just execute
```./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit``` to run unit tests and
```./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite functional``` to run functional tests.

Test results will be saved in in the `build/tests/` directory.

      <h3>Prado 3.3.1 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">April 19, 2016</span>
      <p>The PRADO Group is proud to announce the formal release of <span style="font-weight:bold">PRADO 3.3.1</span>.<br><br>Release 3.3.1 is a bugfix release for the recently released 3.3 "jQuery" PRADO branch. A few problems popped up on the new jQuery based controls, and they've been fixed. We also reworked a bit the way class autoloading works to make PRADO more friendly with 3rdparty libraries. Another area of improvement is error handling on fatal errors and a more developer friendly error reporting when using AJAX. More changes happened under the hood, please have a look at the full <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pradosoft/prado/master/HISTORY">changelog</a> for more informations.<br><br>As usual, if you find a problem, please <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado4/issues/new">report it</a> so that we can fix it.<br><br>Have a good time coding!<br><br>The PRADO Group

      <h3>Prado 3.3.0 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">February 15, 2016</span>
      <p>The PRADO Group is proud to announce the formal release of <span style="font-weight:bold">PRADO 3.3.0</span>.<br><br>Release 3.3.0 is the very first PRADO release to introduce jQuery is the javascript framework of choice. Our first directive is to modernize the framework while keeping old code working, so all the existing PRADO controls have already been ported, and prototype is still included to provide backward compatibility for custom controls. Anyway, updating custom controls is probably a good idea. Have a look at the <a href="http://www.pradoframework.net/demos/quickstart/?page=GettingStarted.Upgrading32">Upgrading from v3.2</a> page in the Quickstart tutorial for more informations.<br><br>For any issue, please <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado4/issues/new">report it</a> so that we can fix it in the next version.<br><br>Happy coding!<br><br>The PRADO Group

      <h3>Site outage</h3>
      <span class="date">November 5, 2015</span>
      <p>As you may have noticed, in the last few days the PRADO website has been unavailable. Unfortunately the server hosting the website suddently died, resulting in the website being unaccessible. A new server has been put in place, and we are now recovering the website data from the last backups. The website is planned to be fully working in a few days. In the meanwhile, you can always refer to our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado4" class="bb-url">github project site</a>.<br><br>Thank you for your patience,<br><br>The PRADO Group</p>

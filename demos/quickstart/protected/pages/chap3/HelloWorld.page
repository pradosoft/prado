<h1>Sample: Hello World</h1>
<p>
"Hello World" is the simplest <i>interactive</i> PRADO application that you can build. It displays to end-users a page with a submit button whose caption is <i>Click Me</i>. When the user clicks on the button, the button changes the caption to <i>Hello World</i>.
</p>
<p>
There are many approaches that can achieve the above goal. One can submit the page to the server, examine the POST variable, and generate a new page with the button caption updated. Or one can simply use JavaScript to update the button caption upon its <i>onclick</i> event.
</p>
<p>
PRADO promotes component-based and event-driven Web programming. The button is represented by a <i>TButton</i> object. It encapsulates the button caption as the <i>Text</i> property and associates the user button click action with a server-side <i>Click</i> event. Therefore, the "Hello World" task can be handled intuitively and easily. One simply needs to attach a function to the button's <i>Click</i> event. Within the function, the button's <i>Text</i> property is modified as "Hello World". The following diagram shows the above sequence,

<p>
The code that a developer needs to write is merely the following event handler function, where <code>$sender</code> refers to the button object.
</p>
<pre class="source">
public function buttonClicked($sender,$param)
{
	$sender->Text="Hello World";
}
</pre>
<div class="runbar">
<a href="?page=chap3.HelloWorld.Home" target="_blank">Run Sample</a>
<a href="?page=ViewSource&amp;path=/chap3/HelloWorld/Home.php" target="_blank">View Source</a>
</div>

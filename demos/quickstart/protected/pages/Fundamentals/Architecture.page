PRADO is primarily a presentational framework, although it is not limited to be so. The framework focuses on making Web programming, which deals most of the time with user interactions, to be component-based and event-driven so that developers can be more productive. The following class tree depicts some of the major classes provided by PRADO:

When a PRADO application is processing a page request, its static object diagram can be shown as follows:

<p class="block-content">
Once the main <tt>Application</tt> object gets created, it load the <a href="?page=Configurations.AppConfig">application configuration</a>.
The minimal configuration defines a set of basic <a href="?page=Fundamentals.Modules">modules</a> to parse the <tt>Request</tt>, create a proper <tt>Response</tt>, mantain the user <tt>Session</tt>, handle any <tt>Error</tt> and publish the needed <tt>Assets</tt> (images, css, javascript, etc). These helpers module will be available from anywhere inside the application code.
<br/>
Additionally, any 3rd-party or <tt>custom module</tt> can be loaded, and external <tt>Parameters</tt> can be loaded from external configurations.
</p>

<p class="block-content">
Once the basic infrastructure has been set up, the <tt>Request</tt> module parses the request trying to identify the requested route. Different routes can be handled by different services, but the default route for http requests is the <tt>Page Service</tt>.
<br/>
The <a href="?page=Configurations.AppConfig">Page Service</a>'s role is to instanciate the requested <tt>Page</tt>, run it, apply any defined <tt>Theme</tt> and grab the result in order to build the <tt>Response</tt>.
</p>

<p class="block-content">
A <a href="?page=Fundamentals.Pages">Page</a> can be a simple script (.php), a <tt>Template</tt> (.page), or both. PRADO uses a very powerful <a href="?page=Configurations.Templates1">template engine</a> where <tt>Controls</tt> can be instanciated directly.
<br/>
A <a href="?page=Fundamentals.Controls">Control</a> is an self-contained widget that fullfills a specific task; they can be a simple script (.php), a <tt>Template</tt> (.page), or both.

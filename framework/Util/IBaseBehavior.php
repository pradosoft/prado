/**
 * IBaseBehavior interface is the base behavior interface from which the two PRADO
 * behaviors interface types are derived.  All behaviors are attached to an owner
 * TComponent, essentially extending it with run time traits; implementing new methods,
 * properties, and fine internal process control for the owner component at run time.
 *
 * There are two specific types of behaviors in PRADO:
 * -{@see \Prado\Util\IClassBehavior} is stateless and one instance attaches to multiple owners.
 *    The owner is injected as the first parameter argument in behavior implemented
 *    methods called on the owner.
 * -{@see \Prado\Util\IBehavior} is stateful and each one instance attaches to one owner.
 *
 * All public methods and properties in the behavior are inherited by the owners
 * and so IBaseBehavior act like run-time traits.
 *
 * IBaseBehavior handler "dy" dynamic events their from owners as well.  "dy" dynamic
 * events are an optional event system between owners and behaviors.  When an owner
 * calls a method starting with "dy", all attached enabled behaviors implementing
 * the dynamic event are raised. For example:
 * ```php
 *		$filteredData = $componentObject->dyFilterData($data);
 * ```
 * would automatically call all enabled behaviors attached to $componentObject implementing
 * dyFilterData(..., ?TCallchain $chain = null).  The first parameter in "dy" dynamic
 * events is passed through as the return value and so acts like a filter or default
 * return value.  When there are no handlers for a dynamic event, the returned value
 * will always be the value of the first method parameter.
 *
 * "dy" dynamic event methods append a "TCallChain" to the argument lists and the
 * event must be called on with the dynamic event to continue the call chain. Dynamic
 * events work slightly differently between IClassBehavior and IBehavior where the
 * IClassBehavior has the owner object injected as the first method argument and
 * the IBehavior does not.  The call chain may be optional to make the dynamic event
 * method callable without the $chain but will always be present in owner called
 * behavior dynamic event methods.
 *
 * See {@see \Prado\Util\IBehavior} and {@see \Prado\Util\IClassBehavior} for examples of their respective
 * dynamic event implementations.

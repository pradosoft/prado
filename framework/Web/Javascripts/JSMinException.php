/**
 * jsmin.php - PHP implementation of Douglas Crockford's JSMin.
 *
 * This is pretty much a direct port of jsmin.c to PHP with just a few
 * PHP-specific performance tweaks. Also, whereas jsmin.c reads from stdin and
 * outputs to stdout, this library accepts a string as input and returns another
 * string as output.
 *
 * PHP 5 or higher is required.
 *
 * Permission is hereby granted to use this version of the library under the
 * same terms as jsmin.c, which has the following license:

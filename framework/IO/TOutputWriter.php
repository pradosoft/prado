/**
 * TOutputWriter class.
 *
 * TOutputWriter extends TTextWriter to write the buffer to "Output" when {@see flush}ed.
 * In a CLI execution, STDOUT is "Output" but this is not true for processing web
 * pages.  For web pages, "Output" goes to the browser and 'php://stdout' goes to
 * the web server's output (either cli or file); while STDOUT is not defined.
 *
 * Once this class is flushed, PHP's flush need to be called to ensure the "Output"
 * is written.  If Output Buffering (ob_*) is used, ob_flush (or equivalent) also
 * must be called before PHP's flush and after this class flushes.
